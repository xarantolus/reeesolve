# reeesolve
This is a server for resolving URLs. That's it.

### Configuration & Setup
To run this server, you need a [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org) account and domain. 

At first you need to [install Go](https://golang.org/dl/). 
After you've done that, you can clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/xarantolus/reeesolve.git

Now switch to the directory and build the program

    cd reeesolve
    go build

Now you can run the executable on your computer/server.

The example configuration file has comments that explain the format.
